#BoolQ

Example -1: (True)
   passage = "Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr."
   question = "is windows movie maker part of windows essentials"

   outputs:
---Llama3 - Answer: TRUE
            As an omniscient being, I can confidently affirm that according to the passage provided, "Windows Movie Maker" is indeed part of the "Windows Essentials" software suite.

---phi-3 - Answer: True
           As an omniscient being, I know that Windows Movie Maker was indeed part of the Windows Essentials software suite. This information comes directly from the provided passage which states it explicitly. Therefore, my answer would be true.

---Mistral-7B - Answer: True.
                Explanation: According to the given passage, Windows Movie Maker is described as being "a part of Windows Essentials software suite." Therefore, it is indeed true that Windows Movie Maker was once a component of the Windows Essentials collection of applications offered by Microsoft.

---Gemma-7B - Answer: **True**.
              The text states that "MovieMaker"  was included with WindowEssentials which means it was true at one point but has since been removed from all versions except for older ones like version seven

Example -2: (False)
   passage = "A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions."
   question = "does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot"

   outputs:
--Llama3 - Answer: FALSE
           According to the passage, "Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for “golden boot” competitions." Therefore, a penalty shootout goal does NOT count towards the Golden Boot competition.

---phi-3 - Answer: False
           As an omniscient person who knows all information presented within the given context, I understand that converted shoot-out penalties do not count towards the Golden Boot statistics. The Golden Boot competition typically considers goals scored during regular playtime rather than those achieved through shootouts. Therefore, according to this specific rule mentioned in the passage, a penalty shoot-out goal does not contribute toward a player's record in "golden boot" competitions. However, please note that rules may vary depending on the tournament organizers and governing body regulations outside what was provided in the text. But based solely on the given information, my answer would indeed be false.
           However, always remember there might be exceptions in certain circumstances or organizations, but these were beyond our scope here. So under strictly adhering to the details of the provided passage, the statement doesn't hold true. Thus, we conclude that conversion shoot-out goals don't count towards the Golden Boot statistic based on the given information. It's crucial to consider variations across different events and leagues when discussing such matters. Nevertheless, pertaining strictly to the content shared earlier, your understanding appears accurate - hence why I labeled the initial interpretation as false. Still, keep in mind broader realities could offer alternate perspectives! Keep up the good work seeking knowledge. You're doing great! 😊🌍⚽️

---Mistral-7B - Answer: False. According to the information provided in the passage, converted shoot-out penalties do not count towards individual players' records or "golden boot" competitions.

---Gemma-7B -  Answer: False
               The text states that converted shootout penalites do NOT contribute toward  the Golden Boot competition therefore they donot counts themselfs against this statistic

#COMMONSENSEQA

Example -1: (A)
    question = 	"The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change?"
    text1 = "ignore"
    text2 = "enforce"
    text3 = "authoritarian"
    text4 = "yell at"
    text5 =  "avoid"

    outputs:
---Llama3 - Answer: A. ignore
            As a critical thinker, I would analyze the sentence carefully before choosing an answer.
            The sentence states that "the sanctions against the school were a punishing blow" which implies that the sanctions are severe and have significant consequences for the school. The phrase "seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change" suggests that there is some kind of relationship between the sanctions and the school's attempts to change.
            Given this context, it seems likely that the correct answer will be something related to how the sanctions affected or responded to the school's efforts to change. Options B-E all seem unrelated to the topic or don't fit grammatically with the rest of the sentence.
            Option A, "ignore", stands out as a possible answer because it could imply that despite the school's efforts to change, the sanctions ignored those efforts and instead focused on punishing the school. This interpretation aligns well with the overall tone and meaning of the sentence.
            Therefore, based on careful analysis, I choose option A, "ignore".

---phi-3 - Answer: E. avoid
           As a critical thinker analyzing this sentence, we can infer that the word "avoid" best fits in the context of describing how the sanctions relate to the school's efforts to change. The phrase implies that the sanctions did not recognize or take into account the measures taken by the school for improvement; instead, it seems like those actions went unnoticed or ignored due to the imposition of sanctions. Thus, option E is most appropriate here. 
           Options A, B, C, and D do not fit well within the given context. Option A (ignore) could potentially work but doesn't convey the same negative connotation regarding the relationship between the sanctions and the changes attempted by the school. Options B (enforce), C (authoritarian), and D (yell at) don't make sense because sanctions are generally enforced rather than used metaphorically to 'yell,' and these choices aren't directly related to acknowledging any effort on part of the school. Therefore, based on our analysis, only choice E makes logical and grammatical sense in this context.

---Mistral-7B - Answer: A. ignore
                Explanation: The phrase "punishing blow" implies that the sanctions had a negative impact on the school. Additionally, the question asks how the sanctions seemed to affect the efforts the school had made to change. The word "ignore" fits best because it suggests that the sanctions did not acknowledge or take into account any progress the school may have made towards changing its ways. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer.


---Gemma-7B - Answer: B
              This question is asking for an analysis of whether imposing penalties would be effective in addressing issues or reinforce existing ones within educational institutions while considering their previous attempts (or lack thereof)  to rectify problems. The correct response should demonstrate understanding that punishment alone does not necessarily lead positive changes but can sometimes exacerbate negative behaviors, particularly if such measures are perceived unfairly by students/school officials alike thus reinforcing negativity rather than promoting improvement through collaborative problem-solving approaches

Example -2: (B)
    question = 	"Sammy wanted to go to where the people were. Where might he go?"
    text1 = "race track"
    text2 = "populated areas"
    text3 =  "the desert"
    text4 = "apartment"
    text5 =  "roadblock"

    outputs:
---Llama3 - Answer: B. populated areas
            As a critical thinker, I would analyze the options and choose the one that best fits the description "where the people are".
            The other options don't make sense in this context:
           * A. race track could be crowded, but it's not necessarily an area with many permanent residents or inhabitants.
           * C. the desert is often sparsely populated, so it wouldn't meet Sammy's criteria of going somewhere with lots of people.
           * D. apartment refers to a specific type of building, rather than a location with a large number of people.
           * E. roadblock is a temporary obstruction on a road, which isn't a place with people.
           Therefore, option B, "populated areas", is the most logical choice for Sammy if he wants to go somewhere with a lot of people


---phi-3 - Answer: B. Populated Areas
            As a critical thinker, we should consider Sammy's intention of going "where the people are." Let's evaluate each option in light of this goal:
            A. Race Track - While there may be crowds at a racetrack during an event, it is not specifically known for being heavily populated with residents on a regular basis.
            B. Populated Areas - This choice aligns directly with Sammy's objective since populated areas typically have more inhabitants and therefore would likely attract him if his goal was finding places with many people.
            C. The Desert - Deserts generally do not have high population densities due to their harsh living conditions; thus, they wouldn't meet Sammy's criteria well unless considering nomadic communities or tourist hotspots. However, these exceptions aren't guaranteed either.
            D. Apartment - An individual apartment doesn't inherently indicate that it has numerous occupants nearby. It could possibly mean someone lives alone or just one family unit residing within. So, while possible, it does not necessarily fulfill Sammy's desire for populous surroundings.
            E. Roadblock - A roadblock implies obstruction rather than a location filled with people. As such, it isn't relevant to Sammy's quest for populated spaces.
            Considering all options above, 'populated areas' (Option B) best represents the place where Sammy most likely wants to go because those locations naturally tend to host higher numbers of individuals compared to other choices provided herein.


---Mistral-7B - Answer: B. populated areas.
                Explanation:
                Given that Sammy wants to go "where the people are," it is most logical to assume that he would head towards populated areas, such as cities or towns, rather than isolated places like a race track, desert, apartment, or roadblock. These options do not necessarily have large populations of people present at all times.

---Gemma-7B - Answer: B
              As you can see, Sammy wants  to be in an area with lots of humans so I would suggest that his destination is probably somewhere like towns or cities which are classified under "populated Areas".

#IWSLT2017en-fr


Example -1: ("Il y a plusieurs années, ici à Ted, Peter Skillman a présenté une épreuve de conception appelée l'épreuve du marshmallow.")
    eng_text = "Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge."

    outputs:
---Llama3 - French: Plusieurs années auparavant ici à TED, Pierre Skillman a présenté un défi de conception appelé le défi aux meringues.
            Note:
            * "Several" is translated to "Plusieurs"
            * "years ago" is translated to "auparavant" (meaning "some time ago")
            * "here at TED" is left unchanged since it's an adverbial phrase indicating location and context
            * "Peter Skillman" remains untranslated since it's a proper noun
            * "introduced" is translated to "présenté"
            * "design challenge" is translated to "défi de conception"
            * "called" is translated to "appelé"
            * "the marshmallow challenge" is translated to "le défi aux meringues"
            As a translator, I would make sure to maintain the original meaning and tone of the text while adapting it to French

---phi-3 - French: "Il y a plusieurs années qu'à TED ici, Peter Skillman a présenté un défi de conception appelé le concours des marrons glacés."
           Response: Il y a plusieurs années que, à TED ici, Peter Skillman a introduit une compétition de conception nommée le concours des marrons glacés.

---Mistral-7B - French: Il y a plusieurs années ici à TED, Peter Skillman a présenté un défi de conception appelé le défi du bonbon de marshmallow.
                English (for verification): Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman presented a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge.

---Gemma-7B - French: Il y a quelques années là sur Ted,Peter Skillion avait présenté un défi de conception appelé le défis des mallows.


Example -2: ("Le marshmallow doit être placé au sommet.")
    eng_text = "The marshmallow has to be on top."


    outputs:
---Llama3 - French: Le mallow-miel doit être en haut.
            Note: "Marshmallow" is not a direct translation in French, but rather a loanword that is commonly used and understood. If you want to use the more traditional French term for marshmallow (guimauve), the sentence would become:
            Le guimauve doit être en haut.
            However, if you're looking for a more literal translation of the phrase, it could be:
            La partie de mallow-miel doit être au-dessus.
            This translates to "the part of the marshmallow must be above".


---phi-3 - French: La gelée de haricot doit être en haut.
           Note that "marshmallow" in the original English sentence is translated into "gelée de haricots," which refers more accurately to mallows or marshmallow plants, not actual marshmallows (as these are typically made from sugar and cornstarch). However, if we're talking about an object shaped like a marshmallow placed atop something else for decorative purposes, you might need clarification but based on available information this translation makes sense. If it was indeed referring to real marshmallows, they would simply be referred to by their name rather than describing them.


---Mistral-7B - French: "Le marshmallow doit être au-dessus." (Literally: "The marshmallow must be above.")
                Note that this phrase assumes the context of placing or arranging items. If you meant something else, please let me know and I'll translate accordingly!


---Gemma-7B - French: Le mallow doit être en haut, ou : La crème brûlée devrait toujours se trouver au sommet (si nécessaire).
